# Language-Detection

The aim of this project is to analyze a text in order to detect its language. 
The idea is to find the occurrence frequencies of the characters in the text. 
These frequecies are considered as probability distribution and will be used for several purposes:

1. Detect the language of a text by comparing its probability distribution with several distribution 
probabilities of languages (english, french, spanish, and germany).
2. Compress a text by using Huffman algorithm.
